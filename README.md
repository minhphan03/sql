#### Techniques
* [Correlated Subquerries](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/sql-correlated-subqueries/) to explain [finding min price among wands with same power and age, then print all minimum priced wands with different ages and powers](https://github.com/minhphan03/sql/blob/main/hackerrank/min-price-choices.sql).
* [Having vs. Where](https://www.sqltutorial.org/sql-having/) which states that having is used after group by to apply conditions on groups.
* [Inner joins](https://www.sqlservertutorial.net/sql-server-basics/sql-server-self-join/). Focus on 2nd example and notice the use of > (larger than) sign on id numbers to eliminate two-way repetition of customers (A ~ B = B ~ A)
